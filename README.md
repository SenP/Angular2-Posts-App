#Posts App built on Angular 2

This is a sample app using Angular2 RC1

It uses http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com to simulate HTTP calls.

Features:

  - Show navigation bar with links for Users and Posts views
  - Users View:
    - Show list of users
    - Edit and Delete links for each user
    - Add a new User using a new form
  - Posts View:
  	- Show list of posts
    - Filter Posts by User
    - Pagination of Posts
    - Show associated comments on a Post when clicked

As the backend is read-only, Add/Edit/Remove actions are currently in-memory simulations.
